These owners may contribute tothe Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production ofcreative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greaterdistribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation ofadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright andRelated Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work andpublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or herCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legaleffect of CC0 on those rights.1.

The License shall be deemed effective   as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of   the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under   applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not   invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby   affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims   and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to4.
